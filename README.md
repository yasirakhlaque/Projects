# Projects

This repository contains all the projects created by me for practice purposes. I aim to add new projects every month.

I will only include projects that I have personally created. Examples include login forms, mini-games, and the front-end work of web pages. Note that this is a private repository and only a few people have access to it.

I love creating projects related to web development.
